## 📖 Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze wine quality data using various multivariate statistical techniques. We explore factors that influence wine quality, the impact of wine color on quality, and the relationships between different chemical properties using methods such as PCA, MANOVA, Factor Analysis, Clustering, and Canonical Correlation Analysis.

## 🎯 Research Questions  
1. Does wine quality differ across different wine colors?  
2. What factors influence the quality of wine?  
3. What factors affect alcohol content in wine?  

## 🗂️ Contents  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial data exploration, summary statistics, and visualizations.  
- **Inference of Mean Vector**: Hotelling’s T² test and normality assumption checks.  
- **Comparisons of Several Multivariate Means**: MANOVA and hypothesis testing.  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & Principal Component Regression (PCR)**: Dimensionality reduction and regression.  
- **Factor Analysis & Factor Rotation**: Identifying underlying factors affecting wine quality.  
- **Discrimination & Classification**: Using classification techniques to predict wine quality.  
- **Clustering**: Hierarchical and K-means clustering applied to the dataset.  
- **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**: Examining relationships between chemical and sensory variables.
